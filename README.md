# Posters

# Demo: 'https://posters-app.herokuapp.com/'

## The User's

When deciding upon the purpose of my App, I considered creating an app in which users will be able to buy and own there favourite superhero/ villian posters.
I idea is that users can create their own accounts with a personal user name and browse the site until they find the product they love.
The user will be able to add a particular quantity of product to the cart, Once in the cart the user can review what they are about to purchase and amend the quantity
by either adding or subtracting. 
Once ready the user can select the checkout and they will be prompted to enter their payment details including delivery address.
In order to go to checkout the user must first login.
The user will be able to easily tell if they are signed in or out. 

### Features

## How it looks on different screen sizes and browsers:
   - Mobile: The pages fit in nicely, '375 X 667'. The Navigation bar is changed to a Hamburger drop down.
   - Tested â€˜Support Form', Logging in and Registering across all screen sizes.
   - Tablet: Again, fits nicely '768 X 1024'. The Navigation stays the same as Desktop screen.
   - All photos and text fit in. Text is centred. 
   - I have tested all screens on multiple Browsers, including,
     Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer.
## Deployment: 
    - I have deployed this project on both Github and Heroku
    - I first ran a git init and started to track my files/images and committed them and then 
      pushed them up to Github, were they all open and load with no issues. 
    - I then logged into my github profile page and clicked on my project's name.
    - Clicked on settings, scrolled down to Github Pages,
    - Under source, Selected master branch. 
    - Deployment Github Link: https://github.com/Nathanduggan/posters
    Heroku:
    - Heroku Deployment: Python package runs the http server for the app, the
      Procfile gives Heroku the information to run the app and requirements.txt is a file that
      contains all the Python packages required to run the app.
    - Heroku Link: https://posters-app.herokuapp.com/
    - I deployed my project on Heroku. Link: https://posters-app.herokuapp.com/
    - I first ran a git init and started to track my files/images and committed them and then 
      pushed them up to Heroku, were they all open and load with no issues.
    - After setting up the Heroku account I simple connect Heroku with Github
      and pushed the code and deployed the Branch.

## Issues during deployment
    - I came across a number of issues while trying to deploy to Heroku.
    - I had multiple application errors or web pages not found errors.
    - I used all my resources to finally resolve the issues and learnt a lot in the process.
    - Some issues I came across: I decided to move from AWS Cloud9 To Visual Stduio Code 
      as I Thought AWS Was very restrictive.
    - While using VSC, I hadn't installed certain softwares correctly like psycopg2 Or whitenoise.
    - Thankfully after some troubeshooting I managed to get the project deployed on Heroku.
